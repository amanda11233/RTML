    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this Lab, I have experimented with two types of image classification models (AlexNet, GoogleNet).\n",
    "Experiments with the models were done with the help of the pytorch library\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "### AlexNet\n",
    "For the AlexNet model, we have tried two methods (Sequential API and Module API)\n",
    "The Sequential API is a sraightforward approach for the model which is just a sequence of layers inside a pytorch sequential layer\n",
    "It is a relatively simple way of creating a deep learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Module API is more flexible and modular approach for the model. It allows multiple inputs and ouputs. \n",
    "The training of the AlexNet model was done for 10 epochs with learning rate of 0.001 and momentum of 0.9, the loss function used is CrossEntropy Loss Function \n",
    "and the optimizer used is SGD (Stochasti Gradient Decent)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the googlenet, we have experimented with implementation of the googlenet model from the scratch and also the pytorch pretrained library.\n",
    "The training of the googlenet is done for  25 epoch for scratch and 10 epoch for pretrained. The learning rate is 0.001, momentum is 0.9, loss function is CrossEntropy loss function and the optimizer is Adam.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset experimented on is the CIFAR-10 dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "For both alexnet and googlenet inception model implemenation from the scratch, we have followed the same architecture mentioned in the respective papers. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Counting parameters \n",
    "\n",
    "The total numbers of trainable parameters for AlexNet is 57,044,810 and the total number of trainable parameters for GoogLeNet is 10,631,486.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Results\n",
    "### AlexNet Sequential \n",
    "The result for the alexnet sequential is aproximately accuracy of 77%\n",
    "The time taken for the training was around 300 seconds per epoch\n",
    "\n",
    "![alex seq results](alex_seq_result.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### AlexNet Module API \n",
    "The result for the alexnet module api is aproximately accuracy of 77%\n",
    "The time taken for the training was around 300 seconds per epoch\n",

    "\n",
    "### Inception Model\n",
    "The result for the insecption model is approximately accuracy of 84%\n",
    "The time taken for training is around 750 seconds per epoch \n",
    "\n",
    "![ins res](result.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![ins loss](googlenet_loss.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The result for the pretrained inception model from pytorch is aproximately accuracy of 90%\n",
    "The time taken for training is around 300 seconds per epoch \n",

    "#### Comparing AlexNet Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Between AlexNet Sequential and AlexNet Module, both of the accurary is 77% and the time taken for both of the methods also seems to be same.\n",
    "The module api method seems to be better to use because it is more flexible and structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparing GoogleNet (Pretrained vs Scratch)\n",
    "Between the Googlenet pretrained and the scratch implementation, the pretrained model seems to be performing better with accuracy of around 90%. The time taken for the training is also faster for the pretrained model. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparing GoogleNet with AlexNet\n",
    "\n",
    "Betweent the AlexNet and GoogleNet, the Googlenet inception model seems to be performing better with accuracy of 90% compared to accuracy of 77% in the alexnet.\n",
    "The Alexnet seems to be training faster as it is less complex and has less layers than the GoogLeNet Inception model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pretrained inception model also seem to be performing better in the CIFAR-10 dataset compared to the pretrained AlexNet \n",

    "### Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "This lab gives a thorough and brief explanation of how AlexNet and GoogleNet Inception model works. The scratch implementation of the models demonstrates the architecture of both of the models. We also learned that goolgenet performs better than AlexNet even if it has fewer parameters. It also seems that both of the model are able to generalize but googlenet model has a better generalization ability as the accuracy of the googlenet model pretrained in the ImageNet dataset reached 90% on only 10 epochs of training in the CIFAR-10 dataset."
